# RUG, MA Digital Humanities Thesis Project: Mapping Governance Strategies for AI Sustainability – An Analysis of Regulatory Frameworks

## Description:
This is a README file for the repository of the Thesis project “Mapping Governance Strategies for AI Sustainability: An Analysis of Regulatory Frameworks”. This thesis was written to complete the Master's Program in Digital Humanities at the University of Groningen.

This repository contains a notebook in which a computational analysis was conducted on legal documents concerning AI governance from the European Union, United States, and China. The analysis was performed using seeded Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify key themes related to AI sustainability. The repository includes the dataset of legal documents used for the analysis. Moreover, this file contains links to all the interactive visualizations created using the Voyant tool, allowing users to view and explore the visualizations.

## Thesis Abstract: 
From a perspective of Digital Humanities tools criticism, this thesis investigates the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainability, with a focus on regulatory frameworks in the European Union (EU), the United States (USA), and China. The research aims to understand how these regions address AI's environmental and ethical implications, balancing innovation with sustainability. It employs a comprehensive methodological approach, including natural language processing (NLP) techniques of LDA topic modeling, to analyze a substantial corpus of legal documents from the three regions. This analysis identifies key themes and trends in AI governance, providing a detailed comparison of their respective strategies. The findings reveal significant differences in how the EU, USA, and China approach AI sustainability. The EU emphasizes a human-centric and ethical framework, integrating sustainability into its legislative processes. The USA adopts a more decentralized, market-driven approach, focusing on innovation and voluntary guidelines. In contrast, China employs a state-centric model, embedding AI development within broader national economic growth and technological advancement strategies. The research identifies several critical issues that must be addressed to achieve sustainable AI. High energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from AI operations pose significant environmental challenges. The depletion of nonrenewable resources, driven by the need for rare minerals in AI hardware, further exacerbates environmental concerns. This work strongly advocates for an interdisciplinary path toward AI sustainability. This approach preassumes collaboration among experts such as environmental scientists, ethicists, legal scholars, and policymakers. It holds great potential to lead to innovative solutions that integrate technological advancements with sustainability principles. This work is a call for action crucial for the future of AI development. This thesis provides a foundational understanding of AI sustainability and underscores the need for further research and interdisciplinary efforts. The comparative analysis of the EU, USA, and China offers valuable insights into diverse regulatory approaches, identifying best practices and potential areas for improvement in global AI governance.
